The goal of the Embed API is to facilitate bi-directional communication between inSided apps and an external client's domain. This would accommodate clients to embed an inSided app onto their own page with a simple inline HTML snippet, after which the App would communicate back to inSided servers and initialize. </p> <p> My initial task was to research and document how the original Embed API was implemented and how it worked. The code was written by an older employee who had left the company, causing much of the technical knowledge about the Embed API to be lost. </p> <p> My second task was to refactor and extend the Embed API, and finally implementing it for use on the Volkswagen website. Volkswagen uses the inSided Reviews & Ratings App, allowing visitors to rate and review their latest vehicle models. </p> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class="twelve columns"> <a class="close-project button u-full-width"> Back to Projects </a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container project-page t-mobile hidden" data-project=t-mobile> <div class="row project-content"> <div class="six columns"> <div class="project-image u-max-full-width"> <span></span> </div> <img class=u-max-full-width src=images/193625ab.project_t-mobile.01.png alt="T-Mobile logo"> </div> <div class="six columns project-description"> <h3>T-Mobile Forum</h3> <p> The heart of inSided's Community platform is their in-house developed forum. As a Front-End developer in their core team, I was mainly focused on developing new features or extending existing ones; most of these were directly related to the forum product. </p> <p> Once the changes we worked on would get pushed to production, they would almost always be rolled out to clients' forum product instantly. This meant that every new feature could have a huge impact and mistakes would become critical. </p> <p> One of the features I worked extensively on was the login/registration system, this was a singular platform wide instance, allowing users to have a single account for all offered products and features. One of my proudest moments was seeing my changes deployed to all clients, knowing that I had worked hard to ensure a bug-free addition to the platform could finally be used by the user. </p> </div> <div class=row> <div class="twelve columns"> <a class="close-project button u-full-width"> Back to Projects </a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container project-page rabobank hidden" data-project=rabobank> <div class="row project-content"> <div class="six columns"> <div class="project-image u-max-full-width"> <span></span> </div> <img class=u-max-full-width src=images/7d7e3d56.project_rabobank.01.png alt="Rabobank logo"> </div> <div class="six columns project-description"> <h3>Rabobank Forum</h3> <p> At inSided there are two main development teams, called Implementation and Core. Implementation was tasked with implementing existing features and functionality and designing the products to the desires and wishes of the client, where as Core's objective was to develop the platform itself as well as develop features that clients would request specifically for their offering. </p> <p> I was originally hired by the Core team as a Front-End / JavaScript Developer. Where in the past the Back-End would take on Front-End tasks themselves, as the company grew they were in need of Front-End Developers with a strong grasp of JavaScript to develop core features and functionality to the Platform. </p> <p> My daily routine consisted of cycles of working with different Back-End Developers and feature teams as the designated Front-End Developer, as well as working on my own projects. Many of the features that would be rolled out to clients, I had made some contribution to. I worked extensively on new features to the backend management system, most of which were rolled out to Rabobank's offerings initially. </p> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class="twelve columns"> <a class="close-project button u-full-width"> Back to Projects </a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container project-page fox-sports hidden" data-project=fox-sports> <div class="row project-content"> <div class="six columns"> <div class="project-image u-max-full-width"> <span></span> </div> <img class=u-max-full-width src=images/146bb3ed.project_fox-sports.01.png alt="Fox Sports logo"> </div> <div class="six columns project-description"> <h3>Fox Sports CMS</h3> <p> During my internship at I-Company, I was given the opportunity to try my hand at Back-End programming. This happened quickly after my mentor realised my JavaScript programming skills exceeded their expectations. </p> <p> I-Company is a Microsoft Certified Partner and develops exclusively with ASP.NET, and they gave me a great introduction to the complete process and workflow of developing within the ASP.NET ecosystem. </p> <p> As my first project I was assigned to the development of a custom CMS for the Dutch branch of Fox-Sports. I was tasked with debugging, contributing to the business logic and assisting the front-end developer. </p> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class="twelve columns"> <a class="close-project button u-full-width"> Back to Projects </a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container project-page klm hidden" data-project=klm> <div class="row project-content"> <div class="six columns"> <div class="project-image u-max-full-width"> <span></span> </div> <img class=u-max-full-width src=images/8a4e5321.project_klm.01.png alt="KLM logo"> </div> <div class="six columns project-description"> <h3>Bluebook & Bluebiz community</h3> <p> Two of the projects I got involved in as an intern at I-Company, were the development of the Bluebook & Bluebiz Community. A community for travel bookers and business travelers. </p> <p> Together with a Back-End Developer and an external Designer I worked on some of the more JavaScript heavy features. Such as the Explore page which utilizes Google Maps. I was also tasked with debugging AJAX and jQuery code. </p> <p> These projects proved to be invaluable for understanding the complexity of big projects and how all the consolidated pieces would fit together. Especially how my work as a Front-End / Javascript Developer would affect and be affected by, and how it fit into the development process. It gave me a great insight into the technical aspects of developing big projects, as well as the teamwork involved, and how vital it is to be a team player when delivering a product. </p> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class="twelve columns"> <a class="close-project button u-full-width"> Back to Projects </a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="container project-page sensior hidden" data-project=sensior> <div class="row project-content"> <div class="six columns"> <div class="project-image u-max-full-width"> <span></span> </div> <img class=u-max-full-width src=images/2ae52304.project_sensior.01.png alt="Sensior logo"> </div> <div class="six columns project-description"> <h3>Sensior App</h3> <p> In the third year of my study Communication, Media & Design, we were given a choice of clients for a six month group project. I joined up as the main developer together with another developer, two designers, and a manager to create a solution for the HvA Digital LifeLab, who at the time was researching technological aides that could benefit senior citizens. </p> <p> I was highly motivated and excited about the project and the concept we had come up with. We took it through all the stages, from concept to prototype and at the end we were given a go on developing a more elaborate prototype as proof of concept. </p> <p> As the main developer I had worked out and documented the technical aspects of the product and had taken on more than I could chew. I experimented with full-stack development, and web techniques that were fairly new to me. It was an exciting ride with a lot of overtime. A ride I decided to include on this portfolio, as I'm proud of the progress I've made, and the product we delivered as a team. </p> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class="twelve columns"> <a class="close-project button u-full-width"> Back to Projects </a> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section contact"> <div class=container> <div class=row> <div class="six columns"> <h5> If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to contact me.</h5> <label for=contact-input-email>Your email</label> <div class=wrapper-input-email> <input class="u-full-width validate validate-email validate-required" type=email placeholder=name@example.com id=contact-input-email> <div class="validation-notification email hidden"> <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Please provide a valid e-mail address. </div> </div> <label for=contact-textarea-message>Message</label> <div class=wrapper-textarea-message> <textarea class="u-full-width validate validate-required" placeholder="Hey Arian," id=contact-textarea-message></textarea> <div class="validation-notification message hidden"> <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Please provide a message. </div> </div> <button type=submit class="button-primary u-full-width contact-send"> <i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i> SEND </button> <div class="send-notification error hidden"> <i class="fa fa-frown-o"></i> Ouch!
